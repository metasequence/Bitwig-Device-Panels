Bitwig Device Panels

A collection of Device Panels for Bitwig Studio inspired by: 
https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=259&t=480998

Please see the above thread for installation instructions and tons of other panels.

Device Panels created with Bitwig Studio 3.1 on Linux. 
Panels typically work cross-platform and I'm using the latest (5/2020) Windows version of all plugins that don't have a Linux version, which is most on this list.

Currently all VST2 versions. 

I will be posting updates, new panels, VST3 versions here. Some of these have not been "playtested" so there may be bugs.

Most device panels have all automation features mapped, but a few only have basic / main page functionality currently:
Modartt Pianoteq Standard (Basic)
Arturia CZ V (Basic)
Arturia DX7 V (Basic)
Softube Weiss Compressor Limiter (Ganged Only)
Output Portal (FX2 section incomplete)
Some of the Voxengo plugs don't have a lot to automate.

I tried to include only my original panels in this repo at this time. My apologies if I inadvertently included any others I downloaded/modified.
